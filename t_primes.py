"""
It can be shown that only squares of prime numbers are T-primes, and that there are not too many of them â€” as many as there are prime numbers not greater than sqrt(10**12) = 10**6. Precompute these numbers (using, for example, the sieve of Eratosthenes) and store them in an array or an std::set, then we can answer each query by simply checking whether the number in question is amongst the precomputed numbers.
